## Blastula 

Origin: Brian Law, September 2020.

Objective: A 15-20 minute screenshare with a client on Blastula and how to send (HTML) emails from R.

Audience: data science practicioners

Outreach: Yes, via this sequence: https://app2b.outreach.io/sequences/275

Video: You betcha: A recording of Brian running through it alone (a bit creepy I know) is hosted on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yaRdZ2zob1Aqvjcpy6aekCEN-ggOfUC0/view?usp=sharing). Note that it was recorded using quicktime > File > New Screen Recording.

Other: With this topic there's always a judgement call about how much RSC to bring in or not and it depends on the audience and the day. If they're advanced and get the code instantly then I would skip ahead to talk about .Rmd and RSC more, if not then I don't push it and pile on too much because I want them to mainly come away with confidence to make and send emails from R, which naturally invites a follow up and more discussion of how RSC can work with that and a second call on workflow efficiencies.

FAQ's: 

* Can you build an email, include attachments and conditionally suppress sending it using both with and without using RSC? Yes, see [this](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/12/05/emails-from-r-blastula-0-3/) blog post. But with RSC you always get: enterprise auth, logs, easy scheduling... Just my opinion but the selling point with RSC and Blastula is NOT the functionality we saw above because you can do that w/out RSC, instead, it's the RSC specific stuff (e.g. authorization).
