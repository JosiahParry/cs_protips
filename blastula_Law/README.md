## Blastula 

Origin: Brian Law, September 2020.

Objective: A 15-20 minute screenshare with a client on Blastula and how to send (HTML) emails from R.

Audience: data science practicioners

Outreach: Yes, via this sequence: https://app2b.outreach.io/sequences/275

Video: You betcha: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R9_a_QJeYcx4876Weyz_dDbJDVr6jMa5/view?usp=sharing. A recording of Brian running through it alone (a bit creepy I know) is hosted on google drive. Note that it was recorded using quicktime > File > New Screen Recording

Other: ________   I (Brian) should have done at least 2 things to make this better: 1) ask up front about "how do you all present with tables currently?" and at the end to close with an ask to keep the conversation growing like "can we schedule a follow up call to go over an example of your own?" or "other folks I can help by giving the same screenshare to?".

FAQ's: 

* Can you build an email, include attachments and conditionally suppress sending it using both with and without using RSC? Yes, see [this](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/12/05/emails-from-r-blastula-0-3/) blog post. But with RSC you always get: enterprise auth, logs, easy scheduling... Just my opinion but the selling point with RSC and Blastula is NOT the functionality we saw above because you can do that w/out RSC, instead, it's the RSC specific stuff (e.g. authorization).
