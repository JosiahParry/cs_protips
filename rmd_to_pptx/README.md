## R Markdown with PowerPoint

Origin: Brian Law, September 2020.

Objective: A 15-20 minute screenshare with a client on how to generate pptx slides form .Rmd and even better, how to populate a pptx template from .Rmd.

Audience: data science practicioners

Outreach: Kind of, [this sequence](https://app2b.outreach.io/sequences/212) combines two things: an invitation to check out our conf::2020 materials, and an invitation to screenshare on Rmd to PPTX. 

Video: ____You betcha: ____. 

Other:    should have done at least 2 things to make this better: 1) ask up front about "how do you all present with tables currently?" and at the end to close with an ask to keep the conversation growing like "can we schedule a follow up call to go over an example of your own?" or "other folks I can help by giving the same screenshare to?".
