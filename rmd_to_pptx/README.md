## R Markdown with PowerPoint

Origin: Brian Law, September 2020.

Objective: A 15-20 minute screenshare with a client on how to generate pptx slides form .Rmd and even better, how to populate a pptx template from .Rmd.

Audience: data science practicioners

Outreach: Kind of, [this sequence](https://app2b.outreach.io/sequences/212) combines two things: an invitation to check out our conf::2020 materials, and an invitation to screenshare on Rmd to PPTX. 

Video: Indeed, hosted on google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DQ3E1HOcN2KwAR5i-HxAalOjDm2--xD3/view?usp=sharing). 

Other: This was a bit artificial because there was no audience and so one key thing is that when doing this for real to ask them how they incorporating PPTX into their workflow today. And then at the end to talk about how nicely RSC works with this and frees up their time to do the actual data science.
